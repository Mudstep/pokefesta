# Linux

Install [**devkitARM**](http://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started/devkitARM).

Then run the following commands.

	export DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitPro
	echo "export DEVKITPRO=$DEVKITPRO" >> ~/.bashrc
	export DEVKITARM=$DEVKITPRO/devkitARM
	echo "export DEVKITARM=$DEVKITARM" >> ~/.bashrc

	git clone https://github.com/pret/pokeruby
	git clone https://github.com/pret/agbcc

	cd agbcc
	./build.sh
	./install.sh ../pokeruby

	cd ../pokeruby

To build **pokeruby.gba**:

	make -j4


# macOS

Installing pokeruby on a Mac requires macOS >= 10.12 (Sierra or higher).

To get pokeruby up and running, run the following commands in Terminal:

Make sure you have the right compilers.
```
xcode-select --install
```
   
Download the [devkitPRO pacman](https://github.com/devkitPro/pacman/releases/tag/v1.0.0) package (`.pkg`) and install using the native Mac Installer. 
This will install the devkitPRO package in `/opt/devkitpro`.

You must install devkitARM using
```
sudo dkp-pacman -S devkitARM 
```

Then set environment variables 
```
export DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro
echo "export DEVKITPRO=$DEVKITPRO" >> ~/.bashrc
export DEVKITARM=$DEVKITPRO/devkitARM
echo "export DEVKITARM=$DEVKITARM" >> ~/.bashrc

echo "if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then . ~/.bashrc; fi" >> ~/.bash_profile
```

Now download the repositories. 
```
git clone https://github.com/pret/pokeruby
git clone https://github.com/pret/agbcc

cd agbcc
./build.sh
./install.sh ../pokeruby

cd ../pokeruby
```

Build the necessary tools
```
./build_tools.sh
```

And finally the ROM **pokeruby.gba** should be ready to build
```
make -j4
```

# Windows

Install [**devkitARM**](http://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started/devkitARM) to the default directory (C:/devkitpro).

Then download [**Cygwin**](http://cygwin.com/install.html): **setup-x86_64.exe** for 64-bit Windows, **setup-x86.exe** for 32-bit.

Run the Cygwin setup and leave the default settings. At "Select Packages", set the view to "Full" and choose to install the following:

- `make`
- `git`
- `gcc-core`
- `gcc-g++`
- `libpng-devel`

In the **Cygwin terminal**, enter these commands:

	export DEVKITPRO=/cygdrive/c/devkitpro
	echo export DEVKITPRO=$DEVKITPRO >> ~/.bashrc
	export DEVKITARM=$DEVKITPRO/devkitARM
	echo export DEVKITARM=$DEVKITARM >> ~/.bashrc

	git clone https://github.com/pret/pokeruby
	git clone https://github.com/pret/agbcc

	cd agbcc
	./build.sh
	./install.sh ../pokeruby

	cd ../pokeruby

To build **pokeruby.gba**:

	make -j4


# Compiling Sapphire and later revisions

When you simply enter `make` and don't specify a target, then Pok√©mon Ruby 1.0 will be built. However, Sapphire can also be built, along with revisions 1 and 2 of both Ruby and Sapphire. Here is a listing of each ROM that can be made, along with the command to make the ROM.

Version      | Command
-------------|---------------------
Ruby 1.0     | `make ruby`
Ruby 1.1     | `make ruby_rev1`
Ruby 1.2     | `make ruby_rev2`
Sapphire 1.0 | `make sapphire`
Sapphire 1.1 | `make sapphire_rev1`
Sapphire 1.2 | `make sapphire_rev2`


# Faster builds

After the first build, subsequent builds are faster. You can further speed up the build:

## Parallel build

This significantly speeds up the build on modern machines.

By default `make` only runs a single thread. You can tell `make` to run on multiple threads with `make -j`. See the manfile for usage (`man make`).

The optimal value for `-j` is the number of logical cores on your machine. You can run `nproc` to see the exact number.

	$ nproc
	8

If you have 8 cores, run:

	make -j8

`-j` on its own will spawn a new thread for each job. A clean build will have thousands of jobs, which will be slower than not using -j at all.

## Disable the dependency scanning

If you've only changed `.c` or `.s` files, you can turn off the dependency scanning temporarily. Changes to any other files will be ignored, and the build will either fail or not reflect those changes.

	make NODEP=1

## Preproc

Preproc is a combination of a C preprocessor and a tool to replace incbins and encode strings.

While initially in C++, it was ported to C by easyaspi314.

Original code is released under the MIT License, however, some files use the BSD license.

I use the following libraries:
 - ucpp (ucpp subdirectory): Copyright (c) Thomas Pornin 1999 - 2002, BSD license.
 - khash (khash.h): Copyright (c) 2008, 2009, 2011 by Attractive Chaos. MIT license.

Some changes were made to ucpp.
